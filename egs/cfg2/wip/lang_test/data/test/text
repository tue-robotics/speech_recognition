JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
JonnyGutteridge-20081120-hav-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-02 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-03 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-04 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-05 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-06 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-07 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
Ronin_Sage-20080110-ny-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0111 THE JOURNEY WAS CONTINUED AT DAWN
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0112 JEANNE AND PIERRE BOTH GAZED TOWARD THE GREAT ROCK
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0113 THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN THE GIRL'S ATTITUDE NOW
anonymous0046-20080428-cxb-b0114 HE MOVED HIS POSITION AND THE ILLUSION WAS GONE

anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0497 ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUR LONG DRY SUMMER
anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0498 I REMEMBERED THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIAN RANCHO AND SHUDDERED INWARDLY
anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0499 I SAID AND DISMISSED THE MATTER AS NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
anonymous0122-20081010-uhe-b0500 THEN CAME MY BOY CODE

anonymous0434-20100204-gym-a0028 ROBBERY BRIBERY FRAUD
anonymous0434-20100204-gym-a0029 THEIR FORCES WERE ALREADY MOVING INTO THE NORTH COUNTRY
anonymous0434-20100204-gym-a0030 I HAD FAITH IN THEM
anonymous0434-20100204-gym-a0031 THEY WERE THREE HUNDRED YARDS APART
anonymous0434-20100204-gym-a0032 SINCE THEN SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN FIGHTING US AT EVERY STEP
anonymous0434-20100204-gym-a0033 HE UNFOLDED A LONG TYPEWRITTEN LETTER AND HANDED IT TO GREGSON
anonymous0434-20100204-gym-a0034 MEN OF SELDEN'S STAMP DON'T STOP AT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
anonymous0434-20100204-gym-a0035 HE STOPPED AND PHILIP NODDED AT THE HORRIFIED QUESTION IN HIS EYES
anonymous0615-20100821-sdj-a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER

anonymous0615-20100821-sdj-a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
anonymous0615-20100821-sdj-a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
anonymous0615-20100821-sdj-a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
anonymous0615-20100821-sdj-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
anonymous0615-20100821-sdj-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
anonymous0615-20100821-sdj-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
anonymous0615-20100821-sdj-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
anonymous0615-20100821-sdj-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
anonymous0890-20120118-jiq-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
anonymous0890-20120118-jiq-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
anonymous0890-20120118-jiq-b0368 PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I ALREADY KNOW IT ALL
anonymous0890-20120118-jiq-b0369 YOU SEE WE WERE TEACHING OURSELVES

anonymous0890-20120118-jiq-b0373 UNLIKE JOSHUA HE STOOD IN NO NEED OF DIVINE ASSISTANCE
anonymous0890-20120118-jiq-b0374 TO SAY THE LEAST CAPTAIN COOK WAS A RATHER THOROUGH GOING EMPIRICIST
anonymous0890-20120118-jiq-b0375 MAN COULD NOT CONQUER THEM
anonymous0989-20120706-tmm-b0376 THOUGHT I AND A WORTHY FOOL HE PROVED
anonymous0989-20120706-tmm-b0377 A SCARLET LOINCLOTH COMPLETED HIS COSTUME
anonymous0989-20120706-tmm-b0378 I LIKE TO SPECULATE UPON THE GLORIOUS FUTURE OF MAN
anonymous0989-20120706-tmm-b0379 CHRISTMAS IS AN EASY PROBLEM COMPARED WITH A POLYNESIAN GIVING FEAST
anonymous0989-20120706-tmm-b0380 HE HAD PEELED OFF HIS SHIRT AND WAS WILDLY WAVING IT
anonymous0989-20120706-tmm-b0381 AND HOW WOULD WE EVER FIND OURSELVES
anonymous0989-20120706-tmm-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
anonymous0989-20120706-tmm-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
anonymous0989-20120706-tmm-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
anonymous0989-20120706-tmm-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA

anonymous1184-20140104-zxf-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
anonymous1184-20140104-zxf-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
anonymous1184-20140104-zxf-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
anonymous1184-20140104-zxf-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
anonymous1184-20140104-zxf-b0266 AND NOW PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE FOR A MOMENT

bhart-20100106-djk-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
bhart-20100106-djk-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS

bhart-20100106-djk-a0007 AND YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE IT IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE
bhart-20100106-djk-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
bhart-20100106-djk-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
bhart-20100106-djk-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
bhart-20100106-djk-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
bhart-20100106-giy-a0078 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
bhart-20100106-giy-a0079 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
bhart-20100106-giy-a0080 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM
bhart-20100106-giy-a0081 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
bhart-20100106-giy-a0082 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
bhart-20100106-giy-a0083 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
bhart-20100106-giy-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
bhart-20100106-giy-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
bhart-20100106-giy-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
bhart-20100106-giy-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
bhart-20100106-joc-b0252 IT RESEMBLED TEA LESS THAN LAGER BEER RESEMBLES CHAMPAGNE
bhart-20100106-joc-b0253 THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS
bhart-20100106-joc-b0254 AT THE SAME TIME SPEARS AND ARROWS BEGAN TO FALL AMONG THE INVADERS
bhart-20100106-joc-b0255 THEN AGAIN TUDOR HAD SUCH AN IRRITATING WAY ABOUT HIM
bhart-20100106-joc-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
bhart-20100106-joc-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
bhart-20100106-joc-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
bhart-20100106-joc-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
bhart-20100106-joc-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
bhart-20100106-joc-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
bhart-20100106-jot-a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
bhart-20100106-jot-a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
bhart-20100106-jot-a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
bhart-20100106-jot-a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
bhart-20100106-jot-a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
bhart-20100106-jot-a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
bhart-20100106-jot-a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
bhart-20100106-jot-a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
bhart-20100106-jot-a0160 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT
bhart-20100106-jot-a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
bhart-20100106-kab-b0035 AFTER ALL THE PICTURE WAS ONLY A RESEMBLANCE
bhart-20100106-kab-b0036 HE WONDERED TOO WHERE ROSCOE WAS
bhart-20100106-kab-b0037 PHILIP KNEW THAT SHE WAS NOT AN INDIAN
bhart-20100106-kab-b0038 IN HER HASTE TO GET AWAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THESE THINGS
bhart-20100106-kab-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
bhart-20100106-kab-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
bhart-20100106-kab-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
bhart-20100106-kab-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
bhart-20100106-kab-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
bhart-20100106-kab-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
bhart-20100106-ldp-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
bhart-20100106-ldp-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
bhart-20100106-ldp-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-31 WHEREAS ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE YOU WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO RUN BROWSER
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
bhart-20100106-ldp-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0256 OUTWARDLY HE MAINTAINED A CALM AND SMILING ASPECT
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0257 TUDOR SURVEYED HIM WITH WITHERING DISGUST
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0258 YOU FIRED ME OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN SHORT
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0259 HER MOUTH OPENED BUT INSTEAD OF SPEAKING SHE DREW A LONG SIGH
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0260 IT'S WORTH EIGHT DOLLARS
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0261 AND HE DID HURT MY ARM
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0262 SAXON'S ONTO HER JOB
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0263 ONLY ONCE DID I CONFIDE THE STRANGENESS OF IT ALL TO ANOTHER
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0264 BUT THIS TIME IT WAS SAXON WHO REBELLED
bhart-20100106-lpu-b0265 I WAS NOT TO CRY OUT IN THE FACE OF FEAR
bhart-20100106-mal-a0485 EACH INSULT ADDED TO THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM
bhart-20100106-mal-a0486 FOR THE REST HE WAS A MERE AUTOMATON
bhart-20100106-mal-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
bhart-20100106-mal-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
bhart-20100106-mal-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
bhart-20100106-mal-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
bhart-20100106-mal-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
bhart-20100106-mal-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
bhart-20100106-mal-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
bhart-20100106-mal-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0055 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0056 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0057 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0058 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0059 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0060 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0061 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0062 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0063 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
bhart-20100106-pvf-a0064 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
bhart-20100106-qib-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
bhart-20100106-qib-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
bhart-20100106-qib-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
bhart-20100106-qib-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
bhart-20100106-qib-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
bhart-20100106-qib-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
bhart-20100106-qib-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
bhart-20100106-qib-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
bhart-20100106-qib-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
bhart-20100106-qib-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0003 I CAN SEE THAT KNIFE NOW
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0004 WHEN I CAN'T SEE BEAUTY IN WOMAN I WANT TO DIE
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0005 HIS SLIM FINGERS CLOSED LIKE STEEL ABOUT PHILIP'S
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0006 HE SEIZED GREGSON BY THE ARM AND LED HIM TO THE DOOR
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0007 HEAR THE INDIAN DOGS WAILING DOWN AT CHURCHILL
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0008 BURKE HIMSELF HAD CRITICIZED IT BECAUSE OF THE SMILE
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0009 I'D SAY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS SCRAP
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0010 HE TURNED THE MAP TO GREGSON POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
bhart-20100106-qqz-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0404 PERRAULT FOUND ONE WITH HEAD BURIED IN THE GRUB BOX
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0405 IT SEEMED THE ORDAINED ORDER OF THINGS THAT DOGS SHOULD WORK
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0406 AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0407 MERCEDES SCREAMED CRIED LAUGHED AND MANIFESTED THE CHAOTIC ABANDONMENT OF HYSTERIA
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
bhart-20100106-rfx-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0011 HIS EYES NEVER TOOK THEMSELVES FOR AN INSTANT FROM HIS COMPANION'S FACE
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0012 SOMETHING THAT WHITTEMORE HAD NOT YET SAID THRILLED HIM
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0013 LAKES AND RIVERS HUNDREDS OF THEM THOUSANDS OF THEM
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0014 WHITEFISH GREGSON WHITEFISH AND TROUT
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0015 THEY ROBBED ME A FEW YEARS LATER
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0016 HE CHUCKLED AS HE PULLED OUT HIS PIPE AND BEGAN FILLING IT
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0017 EVERYTHING WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0018 I WAS COMPLETELY LOST IN MY WORK
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0019 HIS SLIM HANDS GRIPPED THE EDGES OF THE TABLE
bhart-20100106-tlh-b0020 HE MADE NO REPLY AS HE WAITED FOR WHITTEMORE TO CONTINUE
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0578 BUT WE'LL JUST POSTPONE THIS
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0579 THERE WAS THE EMMA LOUISA
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0580 THIS IS MY FIFTH VOYAGE
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0581 IT WAS THIS PROPOSITION THAT STARTED THE BIG IDEA IN DAUGHTRY'S MIND
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0582 THE COUNTING TRICK BY BRINGING COCKY ALONG
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
bhart-20100106-wrw-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
bhart-20100106-yty-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
bhart-20100106-yty-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
bhart-20100106-yty-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
bhart-20100106-yty-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
bhart-20100106-yty-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
bhart-20100106-yty-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
bhart-20100106-yty-a0497 KING TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE HE KNEW
bhart-20100106-yty-a0498 THE LINES WERE NOW VERY TAUT
bhart-20100106-yty-a0499 AND RIGHT THERE I SAW AND KNEW IT ALL
bhart-20100106-yty-a0500 WHO THE DEVIL GAVE IT TO YOU TO BE JUDGE AND JURY
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0560 HIS MOUTH OPENED WORDS SHAPED VAINLY ON HIS LIPS
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0561 BILL LINGERED CONTEMPLATING HIS WORK WITH ARTISTIC APPRECIATION
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0562 WHAT THE FLAMING
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0563 MRS MCFEE'S JAWS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A SNAP
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0564 THEN IT IS AS I SAID WOMBLE ANNOUNCED WITH FINALITY
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0565 WITH THEM WERE INDIANS ALSO THREE OTHER MEN
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0566 DENNIN'S HANDS WERE RELEASED LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
bhart-20100108-dsa-a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
bhart-20100108-hch-a0220 A DEAD MAN IS OF NO USE ON A PLANTATION
bhart-20100108-hch-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL
bhart-20100108-hch-a0222 WHAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR HOME
bhart-20100108-hch-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
bhart-20100108-hch-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
bhart-20100108-hch-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
bhart-20100108-hch-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
bhart-20100108-hch-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
bhart-20100108-hch-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
bhart-20100108-hch-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
bhart-20100108-nrx-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0382 I DEFY ANY MAN TO GET A SOLOMON ISLAND SORE IN CALIFORNIA
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0383 A BUSH CHIEF HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0384 THE SKIPPER'S AND NAKATA'S GYMNASTICS SERVED AS A TRANSLATION WITHOUT WORDS
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0385 LAST NIGHT HE SHOWED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0386 MY IDEA WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0387 IT IS MERELY THE SIMPLE SUPERLATIVE
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0388 I MADE NO MORE OVERTURES
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0389 AMONG MY MINOR AFFLICTIONS I MAY MENTION A NEW AND MYSTERIOUS ONE
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0390 THE VOYAGE WAS OUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME
bhart-20100108-uhg-b0391 AT SEA TUESDAY MARCH SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN OH EIGHT
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-25 WHERE ALL THESE COMMANDS MIGHT LEAD TO THE SAME RESULT ON THAT POWERFUL PC
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-26 THE SOFTWARE ON A HAND HELD DEVICE MIGHT ONLY RESPOND TO ONE SPECIFIC COMMAND
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-27 THE SAME WOULD BE THE CASE FOR OTHER TASKS SUCH AS BROWSING THE WEB
bhart-20100108-xpl-rb-28 SEARCHING FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE FILE BROWSER AND STARTING OR CLOSING PROGRAMS
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
bhart-20100108-yqc-b0322 THEIR SUPPLY OF GRUB WAS GONE
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu-a0427 ENTERS NOW THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SITUATION
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu-a0428 IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A DEPORTATION
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu-a0429 QUICK WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS FACE YET SMILING WAS THE ACQUIESCENCE
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu-a0430 NEVERTHELESS WE FOUND OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE HIGH SEAT OF ABUNDANCE
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu-a0431 WADA AND NAKATA WERE IN A BIT OF A FUNK
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu-a0432 THE BOY AT THE WHEEL LOST HIS HEAD
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu-a0433 TO HER THE BRIDGE WAS TAMBO WHICH IS THE NATIVE FOR TABOO
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu-a0434 A HALF A CASE OF TOBACCO WAS WORTH THREE POUNDS
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu-a0435 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT
gman108406Unit-20091119-mmu-a0436 BUT MARTIN SMILED A SUPERIOR SMILE
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0567 NOW IRVINE WAS A MAN OF IMPULSE A POET
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0568 HE WAS JUST BURSTING WITH JOY JOY OVER WHAT
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0569 AT LAKE LINDERMAN I HAD ONE CANOE VERY GOOD PETERBOROUGH CANOE
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0570 BEHIND HIM LAY THE THOUSAND YEARS LONG ROAD ACROSS ALL SIBERIA AND RUSSIA
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0571 HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO BUILD A FIRE AND THAW OUT
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0572 I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE HER IN MY LIFE
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0573 THERE WAS NO LAW ON THE YUKON SAVE WHAT THEY MADE FOR THEMSELVES
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0574 GOOD BUSINESS MAN CURLY O'BRIEN WAS SAYING
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0575 THERE WEREN'T ANY MISSIONS AND HE WAS THE MAN TO KNOW
liquidoc-20100820-gfs-a0576 AND THE BIG PERSIAN KNEW OF HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE HE DID OF HERS
mrurioste-20120927-akr-a0583 ENJOY IT HE DID BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR STEWARD'S SAKE
mrurioste-20120927-akr-a0584 I HAVE LONG NOTED YOUR THIRST UNQUENCHABLE
mrurioste-20120927-akr-a0585 WONDER IF HE'S A LION DOG CHARLES SUGGESTED
mrurioste-20120927-akr-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
mrurioste-20120927-akr-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
mrurioste-20120927-akr-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
mrurioste-20120927-akr-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE TYPHOID
mrurioste-20120927-akr-a0590 IN A WAY HE IS MY PROTEGE
mrurioste-20120927-akr-a0591 WE ARE BOTH CHILDREN TOGETHER
mrurioste-20120927-akr-a0592 IT'S ONLY HIS INDIGESTION I FIND FAULT WITH
mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
mrurioste-20120927-fty-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
neko_nemo-20131221-buj-b0517 EGGSHELL IS NOT GOOD TO EAT
neko_nemo-20131221-buj-b0518 BUT THERE WAS ALSO TALK OF WITCHCRAFT IN THE VILLAGE
neko_nemo-20131221-buj-b0519 YEA I WILL TELL THEE
neko_nemo-20131221-buj-b0520 HANS HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE PROSTRATE MAN STRIKING MADLY WITH HIS FISTS
neko_nemo-20131221-buj-b0521 AND HE THOUGHT OF OONA AND OF HER WORDS
neko_nemo-20131221-buj-b0522 NOR WOULD IT THAW OUT HIS HANDS AND FEET
neko_nemo-20131221-buj-b0523 THE RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYER THE COUNT WAS HER OBEDIENT SLAVE
neko_nemo-20131221-buj-b0524 SO FAR AS FLAGS WERE CONCERNED THEY WERE BEYOND ALL JURISDICTION
neko_nemo-20131221-buj-b0525 NEW IDEA HE VOLUNTEERED BRAND NEW IDEA
neko_nemo-20131221-buj-b0526 THIRTY POUNDS SAID THE CAPTAIN WITH FINALITY
neko_nemo-20131221-gaj-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
neko_nemo-20131221-gaj-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
neko_nemo-20131221-gaj-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
neko_nemo-20131221-gaj-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
neko_nemo-20131221-gaj-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
neko_nemo-20131221-gaj-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
neko_nemo-20131221-gaj-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
neko_nemo-20131221-gaj-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
neko_nemo-20131221-gaj-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
neko_nemo-20131221-gaj-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
neko_nemo-20131221-gdr-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
neko_nemo-20131221-gdr-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
neko_nemo-20131221-gdr-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
neko_nemo-20131221-gdr-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
neko_nemo-20131221-gdr-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
neko_nemo-20131221-gdr-a0394 IT'S THE STRAP HANGERS THAT'LL KEEP US FROM GOING UNDER
neko_nemo-20131221-gdr-a0395 AS FOR HIMSELF WEREN'T THE STREET RAILWAY EARNINGS INCREASING STEADILY
neko_nemo-20131221-gdr-a0396 A RISING TIDE OF FAT HAD SUBMERGED THEM
neko_nemo-20131221-gdr-a0397 CALL ME THAT AGAIN HE MURMURED ECSTATICALLY
neko_nemo-20131221-gdr-a0398 IN THE CAR WERE UNWIN AND HARRISON WHILE JONES SAT WITH THE CHAUFFEUR
neko_nemo-20131221-xdd-ar-24 ONE OF THEM MOVED A BOARD AND SAW A RAT QUITE DEAD HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE
neko_nemo-20131221-xdd-rb-01 HAND HELD DEVICES SUCH AS PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND SMARTPHONES ARE QUITE SMALL
neko_nemo-20131221-xdd-rb-02 MOST OF THEM USE EITHER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OR A MINIATURIZED KEYBOARD FOR USER INPUT
neko_nemo-20131221-xdd-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
neko_nemo-20131221-xdd-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
neko_nemo-20131221-xdd-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
neko_nemo-20131221-xdd-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
neko_nemo-20131221-xdd-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
neko_nemo-20131221-xdd-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
neko_nemo-20131221-xdd-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0100 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0101 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0102 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
rortiz-20100203-gat-a0103 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0548 ALSO CHURCHES AND PREACHERS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0549 DO YOU KNOW THAT WE WEIGH EVERY POUND OF COAL WE BURN
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0550 THIS ALSO BECAME PART OF THE DAILY SCHEDULE
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0551 ALL AN APPEARANCE CAN KNOW IS MIRAGE
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0552 YET HE DREAMS HE IS IMMORTAL I ARGUE FEEBLY
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0553 I AM WRITING THESE LINES IN HONOLULU HAWAII
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0554 JACK LONDON WAIKIKI BEACH HONOLULU OAHU
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0555 JERRY WAS SO SECURE IN HIS NOOK THAT HE DID NOT ROLL AWAY
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0556 WHY HE'S BOUGHT FORTY POUNDS OF GOODS FROM YOU ALREADY
rortiz-20100203-lge-a0557 THE LAST REFUGEE HAD PASSED
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0292 THE FIRE MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
rortiz-20100203-oxw-b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0502 ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR ABNORMAL WAS SUFFICIENT TO SEND A FELLOW TO MOLOKAI
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0503 HIS BEADY BLACK EYES SAW BARGAINS WHERE OTHER MEN SAW BANKRUPTCY
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0504 HE WAS AN ATHLETE AND A GIANT
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0505 WE FISHED SHARKS ON NIIHAU TOGETHER
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0506 THE CLAUDINE WAS LEAVING NEXT MORNING FOR HONOLULU
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0508 SOON SHALL IT BE THRUST BACK FROM OFF PROSTRATE HUMANITY
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0509 YET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ERNEST'S TEST OF TRUTH IT WORKED
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0510 MUCH MORE ERNEST TOLD THEM OF THEMSELVES AND OF HIS DISILLUSIONMENT
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0511 THERE IS MORE BEHIND THIS THAN A MERE UNIVERSITY IDEAL
rortiz-20100203-pre-a0512 NO IT IS A PALACE WHEREIN THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0332 AS TO HOW SHE DRESSED HE HAD NO IDEAS AT ALL
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0333 IT DOES WAS HER AUDACIOUS ANSWER
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0334 OH IT'S JUST A NOVEL A LOVE STORY
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0335 WHOEVER LIVED ON THE RANCH DID THAT
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0336 HOW OLD ARE YOU MOTHER
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0337 HERE HE GOT A FRESH THRILL
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0338 IT WAS UNOBTRUSIVE YET IT WAS THERE
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0339 WELL I'LL BE PLUMB GOSH DARNED
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0340 THESE QUICK LITTLE JOYS OF HERS WERE SOURCES OF JOY TO HIM
rortiz-20100203-vhy-b0341 I PLAY THAT CHOICE WIDE OPEN TO WIN
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0008 GAD YOUR LETTER CAME JUST IN TIME
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0009 HE TURNED SHARPLY AND FACED GREGSON ACROSS THE TABLE
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0010 I'M PLAYING A SINGLE HAND IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LOSING GAME
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0011 IF I EVER NEEDED A FIGHTER IN MY LIFE I NEED ONE NOW
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0012 GREGSON SHOVED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0013 HE WAS A HEAD SHORTER THAN HIS COMPANION OF ALMOST DELICATE PHYSIQUE
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0014 NOW YOU'RE COMING DOWN TO BUSINESS PHIL HE EXCLAIMED
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0015 IT'S THE AURORA BOREALIS
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0016 THERE'S FORT CHURCHILL A RIFLE SHOT BEYOND THE RIDGE ASLEEP
rortiz-20100203-yin-a0017 FROM THAT MOMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR BELIZE TURNS TO HATRED AND JEALOUSY
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0175 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0176 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0177 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0178 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0179 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0180 IF NOT LET'S SAY OUR PRAYERS AND GO TO BED
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0181 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0182 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0183 AND THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY
rortiz-20100209-cys-a0184 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND HELD DEVICES
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-21 A FULL BLOWN COMPUTER OFFERS A PROGRAMMER THE FREEDOM TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-22 THAT ALLOWS THE END USER TO ISSUE A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMANDS
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-23 IN PRACTICE THIS WILL ALLOW END USERS TO ISSUE COMMANDS SUCH AS GO TO PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
rortiz-20100209-ffs-rb-24 GO UP ONE PARAGRAPH OR EVEN I WANT TO EDIT THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH
rortiz-20100209-hzh-b0242 THE JAPANESE UNDERSTOOD AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES OR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND
rortiz-20100209-hzh-b0243 THEY HAD BEEN ON THE SAME LAY AS OURSELVES
rortiz-20100209-hzh-b0244 YOU ARE POSITIVELY SOULLESS HE SAID SAVAGELY
rortiz-20100209-hzh-b0245 HARRISON IS STILL MY CHAUFFEUR
rortiz-20100209-hzh-b0246 THE BOY GREW AND PROSPERED
rortiz-20100209-hzh-b0247 HE WANTED TO GIVE THE FINISH TO THIS FOE ALREADY SO FAR GONE
rortiz-20100209-hzh-b0248 EXCITING TIMES ARE THE LOT OF THE FISH PATROL
rortiz-20100209-hzh-b0249 I KNOW THEY ARE MY OYSTERS
rortiz-20100209-hzh-b0250 BY THIS TIME CHARLEY WAS AS ENRAGED AS THE GREEK
rortiz-20100209-hzh-b0251 THEY MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE CHAOTIC CURRENTS
rortiz-20100209-ioj-b0358 THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO FIFTY BELOW ZERO AND REMAINED THERE THE WHOLE TRIP
rortiz-20100209-ioj-b0359 AND AS NEVER BEFORE HE WAS READY TO OBEY
rortiz-20100209-ioj-b0360 THIS STATE OF MIND COMES OF AN UNDUE PROMINENCE OF THE EGO
rortiz-20100209-ioj-b0361 THERE ARE THE CANALS OF CHINA AND THE YANGTSE RIVER
rortiz-20100209-ioj-b0362 WE THREATEN TO BE OF THE ONE MIND BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS COMPLETED
rortiz-20100209-ioj-b0363 SHE WAS BUILT PRIMARILY TO SAIL
rortiz-20100209-ioj-b0364 IN THE BOHEMIAN CLUB OF SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE SOME CRACK SAILORS
rortiz-20100209-ioj-b0365 MY AGE IN YEARS IS TWENTY TWO
rortiz-20100209-ioj-b0366 I FORGOT HOW EASILY I HAD TAUGHT MYSELF FROM THE PRINTED PAGE
rortiz-20100209-ioj-b0367 ANY AVERAGE YOUNG FELLOW CAN TEACH HIMSELF IN A WEEK
rortiz-20100209-nuj-a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
rortiz-20100209-nuj-a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
rortiz-20100209-nuj-a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
rortiz-20100209-nuj-a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
rortiz-20100209-nuj-a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
rortiz-20100209-nuj-a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
rortiz-20100209-nuj-a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
rortiz-20100209-nuj-a0171 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
rortiz-20100209-nuj-a0172 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
rortiz-20100209-nuj-a0173 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0221 IT'S A YANKEE JOAN CRIED
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0222 HE WAS THE LEADER AND TUDOR WAS HIS LIEUTENANT
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0223 THEY LIKEWISE ARE DISINCLINED TO BEING EATEN
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0224 BUT TO CULTURE THE REVOLUTION THUS FAR HAD EXHAUSTED THE JUNTA
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0225 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS HIS FRIEND
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0226 YOUR FACE WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF DUPLICITY
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0227 SHORTY TURNED TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0228 YOU WERE ENGAGED
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0229 I SAW IT ALL MYSELF AND IT WAS SPLENDID
rortiz-20100209-omx-b0230 NOW RUN ALONG AND TELL THEM TO HURRY
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
rortiz-20100209-orz-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0480 WITHOUT DISCUSSION IT WAS THE AGENTS PROVOCATEURS WHO CAUSED THE PEASANT REVOLT
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0481 THE TASK WE SET OURSELVES WAS THREEFOLD
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0482 MANY OTHER SIMILAR DISCONCERTING OMISSIONS WILL BE NOTICED IN THE MANUSCRIPT
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0483 THE FLOWER OF THE ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL WORLD WERE REVOLUTIONISTS
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0484 THIS THE IRON HEEL FORESAW AND LAID ITS SCHEMES ACCORDINGLY
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0485 THE MOB CAME ON BUT IT COULD NOT ADVANCE
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0486 BUT WHY CONTINUE THE TIRADE FOR TIRADE IT WAS
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0487 AFTER ALL SUPERFLUOUS FLESH IS GONE WHAT IS LEFT IS STRINGY AND RESISTANT
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0488 BEYOND REFUSING TO SELL US FOOD THEY LEFT US TO OURSELVES
rortiz-20100209-uyg-b0489 HE WAS A MERRY MONARCH ESPECIALLY SO FOR AN ASIATIC
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0134 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0135 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0136 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0137 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0138 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0139 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
rortiz-20100209-vqr-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0140 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0141 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0142 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0143 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0144 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0145 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0146 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
rortiz-20121211-fdr-a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0244 HE WAS THE SOUL OF DEVOTION TO HIS EMPLOYERS
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0245 OUT OF HIS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE LAID ASIDE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EACH YEAR
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0246 YOU HAVE HEARD ALWAYS HOW HE WAS THE LOVER OF THE PRINCESS NAOMI
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0247 THEY OUGHT TO PASS HERE SOME TIME TODAY
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0248 I HAD BEEN SAD TOO LONG ALREADY
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0249 ALL EYES HOWEVER WERE STARING AT HIM IN CERTITUDE OF EXPECTANCY
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0250 HE HAD OBSERVED THE BUSINESS LIFE OF HAWAII AND DEVELOPED A VAULTING AMBITION
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0251 I MAY MANAGE TO FREIGHT A CARGO BACK AS WELL
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0252 O'BRIEN HAD BEEN A CLEAN LIVING YOUNG MAN WITH IDEALS
rortiz-20121211-gxz-a0253 HE IT WAS THAT LIVED TO FOUND THE FAMILY OF THE PATINO
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
rortiz-20121211-pta-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0340 IT WAS LIKE THE BEATING OF HOOFS
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0341 WHY DOGGONE YOU ALL SHAKE AGAIN
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0342 SEVENTEEN NO EIGHTEEN DAYS AGO
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0343 YOU MEAN FOR THIS STATE GENERAL ALBERTA
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0344 HE SEEMED TO FILL IT WITH HIS TREMENDOUS VITALITY
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0345 SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS THE APRON STRING AROUND HIM
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0346 GET DOWN AND DIG IN
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0347 THEY ARE GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS BRIGHT OR GIVETH A SOUND
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0348 THEY ONLY LIFTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
rortiz-20121211-wke-a0349 IT WAS SIMPLE IN ITS WAY AND NO VIRTUE OF HIS
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0446 SOME ONE HAD THRUST A LARGE SHEATH KNIFE INTO HIS HAND
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0447 O'BRIEN EMITTED A SHRIEK THAT SANK SWIFTLY TO A GURGLING SOB
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0448 SANDEL WOULD NEVER BECOME A WORLD CHAMPION
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0449 ALSO SHE WOULDN'T WALK
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0450 TO MY DEAREST AND ALWAYS APPRECIATED FRIEND I SUBMIT MYSELF
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
rortiz-20121212-iwv-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
rortiz-20121212-qak-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0223 MY I'M ALMOST HOMESICK FOR IT ALREADY
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0224 SHE NODDED AND HER EYES GREW SOFT AND MOIST
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0225 I WAS BROUGHT UP THE WAY MOST GIRLS IN HAWAII ARE BROUGHT UP
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0226 THAT CAME BEFORE MY A B C'S
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0227 IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OUR REVOLVERS AND RIFLES
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0228 BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE SMASH
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0231 THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER IS AWAY IN AUSTRALIA
rortiz-20121212-qxm-a0232 I CANNOT FOLLOW YOU SHE SAID
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0152 OW A WILD DOG HE GROWLED
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0153 HE WAS A PARIAH A WANDERER WITHOUT A FRIEND OR A HOME
rortiz-20121212-suo-b0154 THAT IS THE STRANGE PART OF IT
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0169 HE DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AS HE LOOKED AT THEM
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0170 THEN HE SHOUTED SHUT UP
rortiz-20121212-vqg-b0171 HE CHANGED HIS SEAT FOR A STEAMER RECLINING CHAIR
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0209 IT WAS NOT A LARGE LAKE AND ALMOST ROUND
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0210 ITS DIAMETER WAS NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0211 IT DROWNED ALL SOUND THAT BRUTE AGONY AND DEATH MAY HAVE MADE
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0212 FRESH CASES STILL ABLE TO WALK THEY CLUSTERED ABOUT THE SPOKESMAN
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0213 BETWEEN HIM AND THE BEACH WAS THE CANE GRASS FENCE OF THE COMPOUND
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0214 BESIDES HE WAS PAID ONE CASE OF TOBACCO PER HEAD
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0215 THEY DIE OUT OF SPITE
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0216 THE OTHER FELT A SUDDEN WAVE OF IRRITATION RUSH THROUGH HIM
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0217 OPPRESSIVE AS THE HEAT HAD BEEN IT WAS NOW EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE
rortiz-20121214-ekr-a0218 THE RINGING OF THE BIG BELL AROUSED HIM
rortiz-20121214-ltw-a0586 WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES AS FOOLISH
rortiz-20121214-ltw-a0587 HE HAD COMPARATIVELY NO ADVANTAGES AT FIRST
rortiz-20121214-ltw-a0588 HE HAD PROVED IT TODAY WITH HIS AMATEURISH AND SOPHOMORIC PRODUCTIONS
rortiz-20121214-ltw-a0589 I WAS SICK ONCE TYPHOID

rortiz-20121214-ltw-b0002 YOU GOT OUT BY FIGHTING AND I THROUGH A PRETTY GIRL
rortiz-20121214-oqi-a0377 THIS SOUND DID NOT DISTURB THE HUSH AND AWE OF THE PLACE
rortiz-20121214-oqi-a0378 THAT'S WHY ITS BOUNDARIES ARE ALL GOUGED AND JAGGED
rortiz-20121214-oqi-a0379 HOW OLD ARE YOU DADDY

rortiz-20121214-oqi-a0381 MY NAME'S FERGUSON
rortiz-20121214-oqi-a0382 DAYLIGHT FOUND HIMSELF CHARMED AND MADE CURIOUS BY THE LITTLE MAN
rortiz-20121214-oqi-a0383 TO HIS SURPRISE HER ANSWER WAS FLAT AND UNCOMPROMISING
rortiz-20121214-oqi-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
rortiz-20121214-oqi-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
rortiz-20121214-oqi-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
rortiz-20121214-pip-a0221 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE AT ALL

rortiz-20121214-pip-a0229 THE LAST ONE I KNEW WAS AN OVERSEER
rortiz-20121214-pip-a0230 DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD LAND AROUND HERE
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0018 THERE WAS A CHANGE NOW
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0019 I FOLLOWED THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED RAILROAD LOOKING FOR CHANCES
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0020 CLUBS AND BALLS AND CITIES GREW TO BE ONLY MEMORIES
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0021 IT FAIRLY CLUBBED ME INTO RECOGNIZING IT
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0022 HARDLY WERE OUR PLANS MADE PUBLIC BEFORE WE WERE MET BY POWERFUL OPPOSITION
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0023 A COMBINATION OF CANADIAN CAPITAL QUICKLY ORGANIZED AND PETITIONED FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGES
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0024 IT WAS MY REPORTS FROM THE NORTH WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCED PEOPLE TO BUY
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0025 I WAS ABOUT TO DO THIS WHEN COOLER JUDGMENT PREVAILED
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0026 IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ACCOUNTING
rortiz-20121214-qxa-a0027 TO MY SURPRISE HE BEGAN TO SHOW ACTUAL ENTHUSIASM IN MY FAVOR
rortiz-20121214-sst-b0307 WE GOT FEW VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AND BECAME FISH EATERS
rortiz-20121214-sst-b0308 WE NEVER MADE ANOTHER MIGRATION
rortiz-20121214-sst-b0309 NOR WAS ELAM HARNISH AN EXCEPTION
rortiz-20121214-sst-b0310 A LITTLE TREATMENT MASSAGE WITH SOME HELP FROM THE DOCTOR
rortiz-20121214-sst-b0311 THE TWENTY NINTH VERY FOGGY
rortiz-20121214-sst-b0312 DIG IN YOU'RE SURE GOOD WAS DAYLIGHT'S ANSWER
rortiz-20121214-sst-b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT
rortiz-20121214-sst-b0314 HE HAD BEEN BORN WITH THIS ENDOWMENT
rortiz-20121214-sst-b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
rortiz-20121214-sst-b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
rortiz-20121214-twh-a0001 AUTHOR OF THE DANGER TRAIL PHILIP STEELS ETC
rortiz-20121214-twh-a0002 NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR CASE TOM APOLOGIZED WHITTEMORE
rortiz-20121214-twh-a0003 FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS
rortiz-20121214-twh-a0004 LORD BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN PHIL
rortiz-20121214-twh-rb-32 OBVIOUSLY WHEN RUNNING A FILE BROWSER THE SAME LOGIC WOULD APPLY
rortiz-20121214-twh-rb-33 WHEN WORKING ON A POWERFUL PC OR LAPTOP
rortiz-20121214-twh-rb-34 COMMANDS LIKE GO TO THE FOLDER WITH MY UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS
rortiz-20121214-twh-rb-35 AND OPEN MY THESIS MIGHT SOON BE QUITE COMMON
rortiz-20121214-twh-rb-36 IT IS HOWEVER LIKELY THAT ON MOBILE DEVICES WE WILL HAVE TO USE MORE RUDIMENTARY COMMANDS
rortiz-20121214-twh-rb-37 LIKE GO UP ONE FOLDER OPEN THE FOLDER UNIVERSITY OR OPEN DOCUMENT THESIS
rortiz-20121214-vks-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
rortiz-20121214-vks-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
rortiz-20121214-vks-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
rortiz-20121214-vks-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
rortiz-20121214-vks-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
rortiz-20121214-vks-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
rortiz-20121214-vks-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
rortiz-20121214-vks-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
rortiz-20121214-vks-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
rortiz-20121214-vks-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0468 IN THE MATTER OF CURRY SHE IS A SHEER GENIUS
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0469 THE EASTERN HEAVENS WERE EQUALLY SPECTACULAR
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0470 HE SPAT IT OUT LIKE SO MUCH VENOM
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0471 I SAW MR PIKE NOD HIS HEAD GRIMLY AND SARCASTICALLY
rortiz-20121214-yds-a0472 HE IS TOO KEENLY INTELLIGENT TOO SHARPLY SENSITIVE SUCCESSFULLY TO ENDURE
rortiz-20151013-art-a0384 THE FARMER WORKS THE SOIL AND PRODUCES GRAIN
rortiz-20151013-art-a0385 THAT'S WHAT CARNEGIE DID
rortiz-20151013-art-a0386 I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT
rortiz-20151013-art-a0387 BOB GROWING DISGUSTED TURNED BACK SUDDENLY AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS MAB
rortiz-20151013-art-a0388 IT WAS MY IDEA TO A TEE
rortiz-20151013-art-a0389 MAB SHE SAID
rortiz-20151013-art-a0390 I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AFTERNOON
rortiz-20151013-art-a0391 BUT HE RECONCILED HIMSELF TO IT BY AN ACT OF FAITH
rortiz-20151013-art-a0392 THERE IS THAT MAGNIFICENT BOB EATING HIS HEAD OFF IN THE STABLE
rortiz-20151013-art-a0393 ALREADY HE HAD BEGUN BORROWING FROM THE BANKS
rortiz-20151013-ebm-a0408 THE ELDORADO EMPTIED ITS OCCUPANTS INTO THE STREET TO SEE THE TEST
rortiz-20151013-ebm-a0409 HE COULD FEEL A NEW STIR IN THE LAND
rortiz-20151013-ebm-a0410 SO WE HAVE TO FIT THE BOAT THROUGHOUT WITH OIL LAMPS AS WELL
rortiz-20151013-ebm-a0411 IT WILL BREAK OUR HEARTS AND OUR BACKS TO HOIST ANCHOR BY HAND
rortiz-20151013-ebm-a0412 THERE IS ANOTHER VIRTUE IN THESE BULKHEADS
rortiz-20151013-ebm-a0413 BUT I AM AT THE END OF MY RESOURCES
rortiz-20151013-ebm-a0414 NOW OUR FIGURING WAS ALL RIGHT
rortiz-20151013-ebm-a0415 IT LASTED AS A DETERRENT FOR TWO DAYS
rortiz-20151013-ebm-a0416 THE ADDED WEIGHT HAD A VELOCITY OF FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR
rortiz-20151013-ebm-a0417 IT IS ALSO AN INSIDIOUS DECEITFUL SUN
rortiz-20151013-iof-b0432 HE IS A CANDIDATE RISING FROM THE SERF CLASS TO OUR CLASS
rortiz-20151013-iof-b0433 WE ARE COOKING ON THE COAL STOVE AND ON THE OIL BURNERS
rortiz-20151013-iof-b0434 THE STEWARD HAS JUST TENDERED ME A RESPECTFUL BIT OF ADVICE
rortiz-20151013-iof-b0435 WELL DID THEY EAT
rortiz-20151013-iof-b0436 FAMINE HAD BEEN MY GREAT ALLY
rortiz-20151013-iof-b0437 NOWHERE IN THE NORTH IS THE SOIL SO PROLIFIC
rortiz-20151013-iof-b0438 THEY RAN THE CANOE IN AND CLIMBED THE HIGH EARTH BANK
rortiz-20151013-iof-b0439 THE LAND EXCHANGED ITS AUSTERE ROBES FOR THE GARB OF A SMILING WANTON
rortiz-20151013-iof-b0440 THERE WERE STIR AND BUSTLE NEW FACES AND FRESH FACTS
rortiz-20151013-iof-b0441 AND THERE WAS ETHEL BAIRD WHOM ALSO YOU MUST REMEMBER
rortiz-20151013-iqt-rb-03 BUILT IN KEYBOARDS ARE USUALLY OPERATED WITH THE THUMBS SINCE TOUCH TYPING AND
rortiz-20151013-iqt-rb-04 HUNT AND PECK TYPING USING THE FINGERS ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION
rortiz-20151013-iqt-rb-05 DEVICES WITH A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE OFTEN USE AN ON SCREEN KEYBOARD OR HANDWRITING
rortiz-20151013-iqt-rb-06 RECOGNITION FOR INPUTTING TEXT THIS HAS A COUPLE OF DRAWBACKS
rortiz-20151013-iqt-rb-07 THE KEYBOARD WHETHER IT'S AN ON SCREEN VERSION OR NOT STRONGLY REDUCES
rortiz-20151013-iqt-rb-08 THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SCREEN REAL ESTATE
rortiz-20151013-iqt-rb-09 ON TOP OF THAT THUMBING OR THUMB TYPING PUTS A LOT OF STRAIN ON THE THUMB
rortiz-20151013-iqt-rb-10 WHICH IS NOT AS DEXTEROUS AS THE FINGERS ARE
rortiz-20151013-iqt-rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
rortiz-20151013-iqt-rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN MICROPHONE
rortiz-20151013-iwe-a0325 WHIZ ZIP BANG LOP EAR SCREAMED WITH SUDDEN ANGUISH
rortiz-20151013-iwe-a0326 CHEROKEE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH HIS INSTINCT
rortiz-20151013-iwe-a0327 THEY WERE LESS STOOPED THAN WE LESS SPRINGY IN THEIR MOVEMENTS
rortiz-20151013-iwe-a0328 THE FIRE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES LIVED IN CAVES
rortiz-20151013-iwe-a0329 AH INDEED
rortiz-20151013-iwe-a0330 RED EYE NEVER COMMITTED A MORE OUTRAGEOUS DEED
rortiz-20151013-iwe-a0331 POOR LITTLE CROOKED LEG WAS TERRIBLY SCARED
rortiz-20151013-iwe-a0332 UNCONSCIOUSLY OUR YELLS AND EXCLAMATIONS YIELDED TO THIS RHYTHM
rortiz-20151013-iwe-a0333 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
rortiz-20151013-iwe-a0334 HE'LL KNOCK YOU OFF A FEW STICKS IN NO TIME
rortiz-20151013-lok-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
rortiz-20151013-lok-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
rortiz-20151013-lok-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
rortiz-20151013-lok-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
rortiz-20151013-lok-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
rortiz-20151013-lok-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
rortiz-20151013-lok-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
rortiz-20151013-lok-b0049 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE EXCEPT A LARGE INK BLOT UNDER THE WORDS
rortiz-20151013-lok-b0050 ALL THIS DAY GREGSON REMAINED IN THE CABIN
rortiz-20151013-lok-b0051 THE SIXTH DAY HE SPENT IN THE CABIN WITH GREGSON
rortiz-20151013-lpi-rp-08 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
rortiz-20151013-lpi-rp-09 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
rortiz-20151013-lpi-rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
rortiz-20151013-lpi-rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
rortiz-20151013-lpi-rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
rortiz-20151013-lpi-rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
rortiz-20151013-lpi-rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
rortiz-20151013-lpi-rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
rortiz-20151013-lpi-rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
rortiz-20151013-lpi-rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
rortiz-20151013-mgu-a0365 THESE RUMORS MAY EVEN ORIGINATE WITH US
rortiz-20151013-mgu-a0366 A WILDLY EXCITING TIME WAS HIS DURING THE WEEK PRECEDING THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH
rortiz-20151013-mgu-a0367 THERE IS NOT AN IOTA OF TRUTH IN IT CERTAINLY NOT
rortiz-20151013-mgu-a0368 I JUST DO APPRECIATE IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
rortiz-20151013-mgu-a0369 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DAYLIGHT THE PAIR RAIDED THE SAN JOSE INTERURBAN
rortiz-20151013-mgu-a0370 HE SAW ALL MEN IN THE BUSINESS GAME DOING THIS
rortiz-20151013-mgu-a0371 IT ISSUED A RATE OF FORTY TWO DOLLARS A CAR ON CHARCOAL
rortiz-20151013-mgu-a0372 HE SAW ONLY THE EFFECT IN A GENERAL SKETCHY WAY
rortiz-20151013-mgu-a0373 POINTS OF VIEW NEW IDEAS LIFE
rortiz-20151013-mgu-a0374 BUT LIFE'S WORTH MORE THAN CASH SHE ARGUED
rortiz-20151013-tgh-b0470 THE VERY THING ERNEST AGREED
rortiz-20151013-tgh-b0471 ALSO A FELLOW SENATOR CHAUNCEY DEPEW SAID
rortiz-20151013-tgh-b0472 ERNEST SAW IN THE AFFAIR THE MOST SINISTER IMPORT
rortiz-20151013-tgh-b0473 THEN THERE WAS THE CAMPAIGN
rortiz-20151013-tgh-b0474 HE WAS MANIFESTLY DISTRESSED BY MY COMING
rortiz-20151013-tgh-b0475 NOT A WHEEL MOVED IN HIS EMPIRE
rortiz-20151013-tgh-b0476 THE REORGANIZATION OF THESE COUNTRIES TOOK THE FORM OF REVOLUTION
rortiz-20151013-tgh-b0477 YOU'RE GOING IN FOR GRAB SHARING
rortiz-20151013-tgh-b0478 THE OLIGARCHY WILL ENCOURAGE SUCH AMBITION AND THE CONSEQUENT COMPETITION
rortiz-20151013-tgh-b0479 VIOLATION OF THIS LAW WAS MADE A HIGH MISDEMEANOR AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY
rortiz-20151013-utc-a0240 WASH YOUR HANDS OF ME
rortiz-20151013-utc-a0241 I THINK IT'S MUCH NICER TO QUARREL
rortiz-20151013-utc-a0242 I SAW IT WHEN SHE ROLLED
rortiz-20151013-utc-a0243 I ONLY READ THE QUOTATIONS

snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0084 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0085 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0086 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0087 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0088 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0089 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
snblitz-20130127-cpq-a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0451 YOU USED TO JOYRIDE LIKE THE VERY DEVIL
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0452 THEY SAW EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BOSTON
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0453 ISAAC FORD THE AUSTERE SOLDIER OF THE LORD THE OLD HYPOCRITE
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0454 EIGHTEEN HE ADDED
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0455 HIS REWARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACE AND REPOSE
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0456 HE WAS AN AMPHIBIAN AND A MOUNTAINEER
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0457 IT WAS SANCTIFICATION AND SALVATION
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0458 THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS WRITTEN ERNEST PROMPTED
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0459 THEY ARE NOT BIOLOGISTS NOR SOCIOLOGISTS
snblitz-20130127-kez-b0460 THE MORE HIS OPPONENTS GREW EXCITED THE MORE ERNEST DELIBERATELY EXCITED THEM
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0487 THE RIVER BARED ITS BOSOM AND SNORTING STEAMBOATS CHALLENGED THE WILDERNESS
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0488 THEIR LOVE BURNED WITH INCREASING BRIGHTNESS
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0489 THEY WERE ARTISTS NOT BIOLOGISTS
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0490 BOTH JOHNNY AND HIS MOTHER SHUFFLED THEIR FEET AS THEY WALKED
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0491 AND AS IN DENIAL OF GUILT THE ONE LEGGED BOY REPLIED
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0492 BURNT OUT LIKE THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0493 THE BOY O'BRIEN WAS SPECIALLY MALTREATED
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0494 O'BRIEN TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND BARED HIS RIGHT ARM
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0495 HE BORE NO GRUDGES AND HAD FEW ENEMIES
snblitz-20130127-rnr-a0496 AND TOM KING PATIENTLY ENDURED
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0039 PHILIP TOOK A STEP TOWARD GREGSON HALF DETERMINED TO AWAKEN HIM
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0040 THE THOUGHT SET HIS BLOOD TINGLING
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0041 BUT IF PIERRE DID NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0042 TEN MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED SINCE HE HAD DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0043 IT WON'T BE FOR SALE
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0044 FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE ATE IN SILENCE
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0045 PHILIP DID NOT PURSUE THE SUBJECT
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0046 PHILIP PRODUCED A COUPLE OF CIGARS AND TOOK A CHAIR OPPOSITE HIM
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0047 SUPPOSE YOU SAW ME AT WORK THROUGH THE WINDOW
snblitz-20130127-tcj-b0048 HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAD PASSED THROUGH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR OR TWO
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0461 AH WE WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER IN THAT MOMENT
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0462 BUT SHE SWUNG OBEDIENTLY ON HER HEEL INTO THE WIND
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0463 THEY ARE HIS TONGUE BY WHICH HE MAKES HIS KNOWLEDGE ARTICULATE
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0464 BETWEEN THE RUSH OF THE CASCADES STREAKS OF RUST SHOWED EVERYWHERE
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0465 HE'LL NEVER DO A TAP OF WORK THE WHOLE VOYAGE
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0466 CAPTAIN WEST MAY BE A SAMURAI BUT HE IS ALSO HUMAN
snblitz-20130127-wtt-a0467 AND SO EARLY IN THE VOYAGE TOO
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0086 HE CAN CARE FOR HIMSELF
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0087 THEY WILL SEARCH FOR US BETWEEN THEIR CAMP AND CHURCHILL
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0088 UNTIL I DIE HE EXCLAIMED
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0089 HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR WAS DONE UP IN SHINING COILS
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
snblitz-20130127-ybt-b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
