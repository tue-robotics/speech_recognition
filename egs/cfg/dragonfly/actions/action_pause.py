Pause action

class Pause(DynStrActionBase):
    """
        Pause for the given amount of time.

        The *spec* constructor argument should be a *string* giving the 
        time to wait.  It should be given in hundredths of a second.  For 
        example, the following code will pause for 20/100s = 0.2
        seconds: ::

            Pause("20").execute()

        The reason the *spec* must be given as a *string* is because it 
        can then be used in dynamic value evaluation.  For example, the 
        following code determines the time to pause at execution time: ::

            action = Pause("%(time)d")
            data = {"time": 37}
            action.execute(data)
