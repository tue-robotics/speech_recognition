Main test runner script
============================================================================

This file is Dragonfly's main test script.  Running it will execute all
tests within the Dragonfly library.


Dependencies
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script uses several external libraries to collect, run, and analyze
the Dragonfly tests.  It requires the following external dependencies:

 * `Nose <http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/>`_ --
   an extension on unittest.
 * `Coverage <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/>`_ --
   a code coverage measuring tool.
